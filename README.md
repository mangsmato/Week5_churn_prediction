<h3> AUC-ROC</h3>
<br>
This code aims at getting the best model and calculating AUC-ROC and F1-Score on imbalanced classification problem

<h3> Problem Statement </h3>
Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers
figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.
We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have the data on
clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.
Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. To pass the project, you need an F1
score of at least 0.59. Check the F1 for the test set.

<h3> Solution </h3>
Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score that can predict whether a customer will churn or not
